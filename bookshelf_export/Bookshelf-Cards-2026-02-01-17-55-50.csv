As we saw in chapter 4, the Declaration's famous preamble depends heavily on Algernon Sidney and especially John Locke, who argued that there was ""nothing more evident"" than the equality of human beings and that ""being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions.""* In saying this, Locke was not innovating. He made it very explicit that he was also borrowing, in his case from a passage in the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity by the Reformed theologian Richard Hooker (1554-1600): ""This equality of men by nature, the judicious Hooker looks upon as so evident in itself, and beyond all question, that he makes it the foundation of that obligation to mutual love amongst men, on which he builds the duties they owe one another, and from whence he derives the great maxims of justice and charity.""' And Hooker was not being original either. He was standing in a rich tradition of Christian reflection on theology and government stretching back to the church fathers and beyond; in the passage cited by Locke, Hooker was quoting directly from the Code of Justinian and Christ's words in Matthew's Gospel. "" So yes, the equality of all humans seemed staringly obvious (at least in theory) to Franklin and Jefferson. But that was because their culture was saturated with Christian assumptions-so much so that the concepts and phrases they used were taken from Locke, who had got them from Hooker, who had got them from Scripture. Franklin's brief, scribbled correction is a marvelous metaphor for the ex-Christian West. His replacement of the words ""sacred and undeniable"" with ""self-evident"" echoes what was happening across European society as a whole in 1776, at least among elites. It was an attempt to retain Chris- tianity's moral conclusions while scrubbing out its theological foundations: keeping the fruits while severing the roots, if you will. And it resulted in the insistence that Judeo-Christian convictions on anthropology and eth- ics were now to be regarded as universal norms on which all reasonable people would agree. The last two centuries have provided plenty of other metaphors for post- Christianity. Consider the common academic practice of replacing BC and AD with BCE and CE, as if the Common Era was grounded in ""self- evident"" truth rather than ""sacred"" belief. Or take the 9/11 wars, in which",1,"Feb 21, 2024",No,0

Don't worry if philosophy doesn't come easily to you. The difficulty is the point (""a feature, not a bug,"" as they say). Sometimes we need the difficulty to get us to slov down and look at ourselves. Slowing down is how we learn to notice what we usually speed past. So just as crucial to the spiritual exercise of this book is an array of images and anecdotes, portraits of time from nature, art, and history, some drawn from my own story, all of which are invitations to reflect on what's right in front of us yet so often invisible. Imagine this book as an impressionist painting of sorts. The point isn't to ""picture reality"" by tran- scribing it; the point is to transform our attention to reality by reframing our focus. The pictures and poems and images are not detours or distractions or ""illustrations."" Don't rush to get through them in order to get to ""the point.""",1,"Mar 17, 2024",No,0

I'm thinking of a kind of temporal disorientation that is unrecognized because it's buried and hidden by the illusion of being above the fray, immune to history, surfing time rather than being immersed and battered by its waves. Such temporal disorientation stems from the delusion of being ""nowhen,"" unconditioned by time. Those who imagine they inhabit nowhen imagine themselves wholly governed by timeless principles, unchanging convictions, expressing an idealism that assumes they are wholly governed by eternal ideas untainted by history. They are oblivious to the deposits of history in their own unconscious. They have never considered the archaeological strata in their own souls. They live as if hatched rather than born, created ex nihilo rather than formed by a process. They don't realize that the homes that formed them were clocks. They can't hear the ticking.

To assert that ""All Lives Matter"" as a response to ""Black Lives Matter"" is not wrong in principle but temporally. It fails to recognize that ""Black Lives Matter"" is something that has to be said here and now because of a specific (contingent) history that got us here. The assertion of the ideal, timeless truth that ""All Lives Matter"" is performatively false in such a situation. It lacks prudence and does not constitute faithful witness here, in this now.

The moment is charged and pregnant, a turning point for the cosmos. History matters. What happens makes a difference. When I, at some point in time, am confronted with the mystery that the eternal God became human in the fullness of time, ""then the moment in time must have such de- cisive significance that for no moment will I be able to forget it, neither in time nor in eternity, because the eternal, previously nonexistent, came into existence in that moment.""s Time and history are not just pseudostages on which to roll out timeless truths, like some mock unveiling of an open secret; rather, the truth is born at the very intersection of time and eternity, like a chemical reaction that requires both components.",1,"Mar 18, 2024",No,0

Musing on the nature and calling of theology, Heidegger emphasized, shockingly, that theology's ""topic"" was not God but instead what he called Christlichkeit-""Christianness,"" or the how of Christian existence. Theology, he emphasized, should reflect the very nature of faith, which is ""not some more or less modi- fied type of knowing"" but rather a faith-full way of being in response to the event of revelation in ""Christ, the crucified God."" Faith is a how and, more specifically, a way of living in light of an event. Faith-the existential transformation called ""rebirth""—is a mode of participating in the Christ-event.

Nor should insight be dismissed be- cause it is almost always hindsight. The Spirit- Hegel's Geist— calls to us in history. Discernment is first and foremost not a matter of explaining history but looking to forge forms of life in concert with the Spirit's unfolding redemption in time. Charles Taylor tries to capture this when he says that, for Hegel, the movement of the Spirit is ""in train"" and ""it is incumbent on men to recognize and live in relation to it."" The movement of the Spirit is something to be joined, which requires something of us.

For Niebuhr, it is our failure to recognize this irony of the human condition- the way our actions outstrip our intentions that leads to hubris. Re- ality is only too happy to refute such pride. That's why Niebuhr emphasizes that recognition is the beginning of wisdom. Every time our pretensions crash up against a recalcitrant reality, we are being invited to the humility of recognition. Being humiliated by reality can, of course, be an occasion for entrenched fury, a fundamental resentment that the world and time will not con- form to our pretensions.

The European conquest of the Americas represents one of the great natural experi- ments in history: impose British rule on North America, and Spanish and Portuguese rule in South America, and see which one does better economically.? The results are obvious. And this is not because the land the north is more fertile or bountiful than the south. Quite the oppo- site, in fact: the early British colonies in the north faced continual risk of starvation, while the Spanish to the south were planting tropical gardens and mining mountains of silver. The key difference, Ferguson argues, was institutional. The north had enumerated property rights, representative government, religious pluralism, and the rule of law. The south had none of these things; each of them had been opposed by Simón Bolívar, El Libertador himself.2 North and South America have been on different political and economic trajectories ever since.

But if you are healthy, educated, safe, and rich, with bountiful opportunities and many decades in which to pursue them, the question of legacy looms large (which you can see if you spend any time around high-net-worth individuals, or even graduates in their forties). Have I made the best use of the gifts I was given? Will I leave the world a better place than I found it? Did I make a mark? Have I done enough? Will they tell my story?

Rather, these credentialing centers are the launching pads for a managerial elite who will go on to occupy critical positions in key institutions, ranging from bureaucracy to business, from entertainment to NGOs, from media to journalism, from art to architecture. Some will remain in academe, a place of remarkable intellectual conformity, where they will assume. the role of elite formation. These educational institutions help shape the worldviews and expectations of the managerial ruling class, who then deploy to a variety of settings where those lessons come to shape most of the main organizations that govern daily life: government bureaucracies, law firms, media, journalism, corporate sports management, phil- anthropic institutions, and corporate offices and boards.

In recent years, leading economic actors have increasingly exercised hard, direct power in order to advance and effect cultural change. The two sides of liberalism-economic and social libertarianism-are revealed to be identical, monolithic, and eager to deploy power in the name of enforc- ing individual expressivism. Their power perceptibly takes the form of unassailable force by an oligarchic minority capable of the effective de- struction of opponents through exertion of economic power, sanctioned public opinion, and professional reputation. Actual control of political institutions is adjacent to this power, and where democratic resistance is encountered, it meets this new hegemony on an uneven battlefield. c 01",1,"Aug 24, 2024",No,0

While that usage may have permanently linked the concept of ""conservatism"" with a variant of ""liberalism,"" the grow- ing recognition that such ""liberal conservatism"" does not in fact ""con- serve"" very much opens a prospect for redefinition. The very label might be repurposed in the effort to reconstitute the conservative elements of the preliberal tradition-the ""common-good"" political tradition of the West. This tradition, of course, did not describe itself as ""conservative""; it was simply the tradition of the West itself. But it was, by definition, ""conservative"" in the sense that it sought guidance from the past, both philosophically, historically, as well as from the well of experience. This tradition perpetuated itself through time and across generations, seek- ing to pass along wisdom of the past to the present and the future. It encouraged human projects that transcended life spans, exemplified in the great cathedrals of Europe. But above all, because this tradition was antecedent to any ideological belief in the promise of progress-which would become the hallmark of modern philosophy beginning with the advent of liberalism-the label ""conservative"" reflects the original es- chewal by the common-good tradition of a social order that uproots, transforms, and destabilizes. Continuity, balance, order, and stability, grounded in the unchanging truths knowable through human reason and also present in the Christian inheritance of the West, were among its constitutive political commitments.

D45B51A9-824D-4F6E-8982-7ADCC3360937,CSipEAAAQBAJ,Regime Change,Quote,," Liberalism was unified in its view that a new elite would and should be a force for advancement and progress in a modernizing world. Clas- sical liberals believed in unleashing the energy and talent of gifted people— especially in economic affairs. John Locke, for instance, be- lieved that society would benefit if governments protected the essential right of property, allowing for the differentiation between ""the indus- trious and rational"" from ""covetousness"" of ""the quarrelsome and con- tentious."" Locke observed an existing society in which the differentiation between the many and the few, aristocrats and peasants, failed to iden- tify and reward ""the industrious and rational.""^ By reordering society on the basis of talent and success, and thus adding value to the other- wise dormant value of the material stock of the world, Locke believed that a new and different elite might emerge. The protection of the rights of property became paramount, thereby promoting the differentiation of talent and inequality of property that Locke expected to develop.

A200DE8B-64BC-4546-85FC-4FAA627A3902,CSipEAAAQBAJ,Regime Change,Quote,," The intellectual progenitor of progressive liberalism was John Stu- art Mill, a figure often mistaken as a ""classical liberal."" In his influen- tial book On Liberty, he acknowledged the achievement of his liberal forebears (such as Locke) who had created constitutional liberties that limited government and secured the rights of individuals. But this achievement, he believed, was ultimately insufficient in failing to take into account the threat to liberty that was posed by ""the many."" The demos posed an even greater threat to liberty because ordinary people were most likely to hold conservative and traditionalist views that would, in a democracy, politically dominate through a ""tyranny of the major- ity."" Through the tyranny of numbers, the demos was enabled to attain a form of social control through ""the despotism of Custom."" Mill's fa- mous argument in favor of the ""harm principle"" —which disallows legal as well as social limits on free expression, inquiry, and action, so long as no one is harmed in their pursuit-was not made merely for the sake of advancing liberty in itself, but in order to provide liberty to ""individu- ality"" and nonconformists who were most likely to spur transformative change.

In the opening pages of On Liberty, Mill points to the need for more advanced people-progressive people-to intervene in societies that have ""no history."" In societies that are entirely dominated by the ""despotism of Custom,"" a form of enlightened rule from outside that society is necessary—a view that was fitting for a man who spent thirty-five years as an employee of the East India Company. In such situations, Mill wrote, ""the early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them."" The only choice to be made is to enforce their progress: ""A ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end... Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. ""

Precisely the fact that [worldview] is about his personality and that the actual combatants—the passions of the human soul-hide themselves behind their reasonable arguments is the fact that has given the age-old war of worldviews such depth and tension. 
However attractive this thought might sound, it quickly appears to be the case that great dangers also lie hidden in it. There is even something burdensome about immersing oneself in it for a moment. The great thinkers of all ages have sought and ruminated, have striven to find the truth. There is a calling for the truth, for insight, for knowledge, in the world. What would it then mean if we, who stand behind all things, at once should announce, ""All that you have done has been nothing other than a reflection of what you yourself are like. You have not brought the truth any closer; you have only shown us who you are, how your personality is composed""? Should the immediate consequence that we draw not then be, ""We wish never to think again. What is the benefit of all study, of immersing oneself in the great questions of life?"" With contempt, the next generation will erase all your efforts, [saying,] ""You have [only] laid yourself bare."" All passion, all striving, all seeking would immediately be lost. We would feel like children who frolic around and play with each other, who perhaps think that what we are doing will make humanity progress, but later, in our old age, we smile back at that delusion. Is then philosophy indeed anything else than a terrible frivolity? We imagine our worldviews, dress them up in a lot of learnedness, and say that we are dealing with the truth; we try to show how things are through many objective proofs, with great calculations, and that things cannot be other- wise. Later, another generation arises and says with hilarity, ""This person thinks as such because he acts as such in all his behavior, because his personality was composed as such.""

As soon as he sits at the wheel, he sees the world from a particular perspec- tive. He has, if you will permit me this loanword, a ""particular mindset"" [bepaalde instelling)-namely, he sees everything from the speed. A pothole in the road, a goat, a grocer's wagon that comes around the corner, a couple of children playing, are just as much obstacles, limitations in his thirst for speed. And as such, he sees the world very simply. For him, all things are crumpled up together as obstacles. He sees them as obstacles. That the child who steps out into the road at the last moment is an only child, that he is the apple of his mother's and father's eye, remains out of view in that instant. He is a hindrance that must be avoided, that must be taken into account, but that beyond this is only experienced as an obstacle. While he is sitting behind the wheel, his ""particular mindset"" — which is entirely focused on the pursuit of great speeds-brings with it (the notion) that he perceives the entire world reality only as hindrance or as favor. This is then his foundation in reality, that is, what we could call his vision of things. Now you will say, ""That vision is the work of a single moment; it counts only for as long as he is driving his car."" I agree with you, but we can also think about it in a more complicated, enduring way. An officer in a war, for example, sees the enemy only from the viewpoint of combat value. That is his ""mindset,"" which his profes- sion, his lifework, entails. That the man before him is the father of a large family, for whom he is irreplaceable; that he is a genius, in whose death the whole world would suffer a great loss because he could bring progress to human seeking—all remains entirely outside the officer's consideration. He does not deny it, he knows well the possibility of it, but it has no significance to him. In his intuition, the great reality of the world is crumpled up in one concept: combat value. The man before him is a soldier and thus has combat value; the machine gun next to him also has combat value. The ""particular mindset"" in which he lives, the particular goal that he pursues, contains the [notion) that everything he encounters can be judged only on the basis of combat value. That is, to use that word again, his worldvision. We can also think about this [concept] in ways that are firmer and less momentary Imagine that four people travel to a country.

Then he begins to think through whether that intuitive grasp that he made is also objec- tively justified, whether there really is no God and no norm, whether he has a right to [carry on] living on the basis of that presupposition. Then he tries to climb up toward the objective. The vision objectivizes itself into a worldview. He only conquers such a worldview through a great work of thinking, through quiet contemplation, through giving account of reality objectively. A worldview is not just a loose, intuitive grasp. Rather, it is supported by arguments, by motives. It clothes itself in the form of reasonableness. It is supported by logical construction That is tiring work, a work of patience and endurance.

It is perhaps the weightiest demand that can ever be placed on someone—to make oneself free of the intuitive vision toward which he is naturally in- clined. It is only with great difficulty that someone who is materialistic in the practice of life can proceed from objective considerations to the conclusion that it is precisely the spiritual that is central and dominant because at the moment he draws this conclusion, he judges his own life. And conversely, it is only with great difficulty that the idealist who is mystically and ascetically inclined will allow himself to be convinced of the hard, sober realness of material reality. The world- vision that lies at the basis of our character retains its influence in all thinking. In all his investigations, the person whose predisposition is strongly religious will continue to see reality differently from the person whose orientation is wholly different. Those are tacts that are hard to erase. Or stated differently, a worldview distances itself from a worldvision with laborious effort, just as thinking [distinguishes itself] from living [only] with great effort. Few things require more self-denial of a person than the demand to arrive at a conclusion on objective grounds, with reasonable proofs, that is diametrically opposed to the whole composition of his life. The tension between living and thinking is very difficult, and to the earnest person, it is also a very painful tension.",1,"Sep 1, 2025",No,0

That worldview, however, bears the objective within it to the highest degree. It cuts the human being down but at the same time gives him the stability with which he can build his life on the truth. His life's resting point is laid not in his thinking but in the truth that is shown to us in Jesus.

He does not strive toward the unfolding of the capacities and gifts of his personality, but rather, he focuses himself on acquiring more and more things. As a character, he allows himself to be trampled on and molded by others as they wish, but he compensates himself for this by their small gestures [of approval toward him], with whatever he can get. You see, thus, a very typical constellation that wholly characterizes such a personality in its every trait. It goes with- out saying that you seldom come across such one-sided [personality] types as I have sketched here, but you will probably find people in your environment who resemble this type to a certain degree.
